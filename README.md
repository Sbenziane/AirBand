# AirBand
*CSC355: Human Computer Interaction* project using two Myo Armbands to simulate air drumming. The program interprets gestures that the user makes and simulates drumming by importing sounds. The idea is to simulate air drumming by sitting down, putting on two Myo Armbands, and moving your arms and wrists like actual drumming to get a real-time drum session recording.

### Milestones:
**Milestone #1**:
- [ ] Connect both Myo Armbands simultaneously
- [ ] Create new 'drum' gesture
- [ ] Devise a way to make sounds (library or import mp3s)

**Milestone #2**:
- [ ] Add ability to create and save recordings
- [ ] Add different pallettes of sounds
- [ ] Look into using moving arms around in a space for playing different drums

**Final Code**:
